## Goals and Objectives of the Course. Structure

Our course is called Aerial Photography with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles And the first question is what is aerial photography? Aerial photography is called photographing the territory of the earth from an aircraft, in our case, from an unmanned one, to obtain objective spatial characteristics and their further interpretation. Of course, a large number of conditions are imposed on the photographing process. They are: a certain percentage of overlap between images, accuracy requirements for determining the coordinates of the centers of photos and much more. Further we will consider in details all aspects and all requirements \## Aerial Photography, History, Application, Trends

An important event that determined the possibility of aerial photography was the invention of the wet colloidal process in 1851, which replaced daguerreotype. The first try to take a photo of the Earth from the air was made in 1855 in Paris by the photographer and balloonist Nadar. But the first air photo from a balloon gondola from 80 m height he made only in 1858. Unfortunately, it was not preserved. The picture shows a photograph of 1860. 'Boston, as the Eagle and the Wild Goose See It', James Wallace, 1860

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_4.jpg) The first aerial photography in Russia was made by Lieutenant A.M. Kovanko over St. Petersburg on May 18, 1886. An ordinary camera with an image format of 12 \* 16 cm was used for this. Images were obtained from a height of 800--1300 m both nadir and perspective.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_6.jpg) Further development in pre-revolutionary Russia is associated with the names of Vyacheslav Sreznevsky, Sergei Ulyanin and Richard Thiele. Vyacheslav Sreznevsky was the inventor of the first specialized aerial camera with a 24 \* 24 cm image format Ulyanin proposed his own improved version of an aerial camera, in which the central shutter worked automatically, controlled by a current pulse from an electric battery. Thiele was one of the first to propose using multi-camera devices for wider capture range. He also was an author of several works on the theory of aerial photography. The development of equipment for aerial photography continued at a rapid pace in Russia and in the world. More and more high-quality solutions were proposed, the first attempts were made to coordinate aerial photography. A new science is emerging -- photogrammetry. And first scientific works devoted to measurements of objects according to their photographic images. In 1910, the International Photogrammetric Society was created. At the same time, a new challenge for inventors and engineers was the emergence of aircrafts, where were increased requirements for aerial cameras. It needed higher shutter speed, higher plate change speed and more. The main development of aerial photography and photogrammetry occurred in the Soviet period. The first regular aerial photography was implemented in 1918. It originates from the formation of the first aerial photography detachment of the Red Army under the leadership of V.S. Tsvet-Kolyadinsky. Already in 1921, aerial photography was used to create the cartographic basis of the Soviet Union. In 1929, the Institute TsNIIGAiK was organized, which determined the development of native photogrammetry and aerial photography for many years to come. At the beginning of the 30s, the first Soviet aerial cameras --NACH-1 and the multi-lens aerial camera of Fedor Drobyshev were created. Before the start of World War II, there was an abrupt jump in the aerial photography development.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_7.jpg) New aerial cameras are being constructed, more sophisticated native aircrafts are coming into service for special aerial photography teams, among which was a Kalinin K-4 aircraft, which was widely used in aerial photography. Production facilities and aerial photo batches are being organized. Aerial photography is becoming the main method for creating small and medium-sized topographic maps. Already in 1931 in the Soviet Union implemented more aerial photography works than in whole Western Europe The development of technology continues after the war, new aerial cameras are created, in addition, new special systems are added - course systems with autopilots, radio altimeters, gyroplanes. Airplanes sharpened for aerial photography comes in production - the well-known AN-30 In the period from 1955, the analytical method of spatial phototriangulation became widely used. The beginnings of digital photogrammetry emerge as well as a complete discipline - space photogrammetry. Despite the important role of the technologies development, the vector is gradually shifting towards theoretical work: the development of the photogrammetry theory and photogrammetric processing of aerial photography rises.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_8.jpg) Especially worth noting are the works of Nikolai Georgievich Kell, Alexei Nikolaevich Lobanov, Victor Ivanovich Pavlov. The basic algorithms and software systems for equalizing route and block networks of spatial phototriangulation are created. In 1988, the creation of a state topographic map on a scale of 1:25 000 for the entire territory of the country was completed. The main method was aerial photography. The next important step was the creation of the first digital aerial camera. In 2000, it was introduced by Leica Geosystems under the name DMC I. In parallel, the computing power of computers increased and new programs for digital photogrammetric processing of images was developed. The latest major jump in the development of digital photogrammetry and aerial photography has been the emergence of affordable unmanned aerial vehicles and relatively cheap and compact satellite receivers. To the current date, it can be argued that aerial photography with UAV is about half of all aerial photography works and this value continues to grow. Current trends in the unmanned industry are: maximum flight automation, data processing using cloud computing, the creation of long-fly devices and the expansion of the payload spectrum - for example, lidars and thermal imagers.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_9.jpg) Let's move to the application areas of aerial photography. We divide the entire aerial photography into two global categories: Artwork and Industrial Artwork should be understood as the production of filming, advertising video-photo shooting, the creation of 360-degree panoramas, although they can also be attributed to the second category. Application of aerial photography in geodesy, cadaster, surveying, geophysical exploration these disciplines can be combined by one principle - obtaining the characteristics of the earth, its surface and objects on it. The second group is united according to the principle of obtaining information about vegetation aerial photography in agriculture is used to calculate vegetation indices and create prescription maps within the framework of the precision farming concept. You can imagine a picture in the near future - an autonomous drone collects the necessary information and transfers it to a smart tractor, also unmanned. Harvesting is automatic. A man can only eat, everything that has grown. Forest surveys are implemented mainly for forest taxation tasks - determining all the characteristics of the forest fund. They use the method of stereoscopic interpretation for that. This method is not inferior to classical taxation in accuracy and performance. Forecasters and researchers suggest that in the next ten years, the main development of unmanned aircraft will fall on agriculture, which, in addition to the tasks of determining the state of vegetation, will eventually be connected with the task of irrigation and fertilizing from the sides of superheavy drones There is no objection to the assertion that unmanned aircraft is becoming increasingly developed and will soon become dominant when conducting aerial photography In the next video, we will consider unmanned vehicles in more details.

## Unmanned Aerial Vehicle

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_12.jpg) As we have already considered, there are two types of aerial photography are distinguished according to the important principle of human participation using manned aircraft and using unmanned aircraft. According to the Rules for the use of the airspace of the Russian Federation, UAV is defined as "an aircraft flying without a pilot (crew) on board and controlled in flight automatically by an operator from a control point or a combination of these methods" As it can be seen from this definition, in fact, UAV can't be controlled without a person. The operator on the ground performs control, and sometimes piloting the vehicle. So there's still a pilot, only an external one.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_13.jpg) The flight can be automatic, then the role of the pilot-operator is to draw up a flight mission and track the process of its implementation. In the best autonomous systems, "drone in house" concept will be implemented. It involves the drone placed on a special base station - it charges or changes the battery, and if necessary, shelters the drone from bad weather. The system will work as follows: 1) The user remotely creates a mission. Aerial photography, delivery, etc. 2) The drone takes off from the base station and performs the task autonomously 3) At the end of the mission or, if necessary, recharging, the drone returns to the base station 4) At the time of connection to the base station, information from the drone is transmitted to the cloud service Now there are already prototypes and first examples working on this principle. The picture shows the system of the Russian company "Copter Express". However, it's too early to talk about the spread of such systems - this is the prospect of the next 10-15 years.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_14.jpg) Let's talk about the types and UAV classifications. There is no generally accepted classification. But there are several approaches. Engine type classification: 1. Electric - almost 100% of drones in the civilian sector are equipped with such an engine. The motors are powered by batteries. These are mainly Li-Polymer batteries. The reason for this is their ability to give high electricity. Since about 2017, there has been a tendency to use the more familiar to consumer Lithium-Ion batteries. Teh reason is the development and appearance on the market of good high-electricity models. Advantages - lower cost and less explosiveness. Also, in certain configurations, they show better flight time compared to Li-Polymer batteries. 2. Internal combustion engine - such engines are installed on heavier devices, due to their own high mass. In general, UAV with ICE is more expensive and more complicated, but they allow you to stay in the air for much longer. For example, Orlan-10 can fly up to 16 hours. 3. Combined and others. This category includes systems that take advantage of the first two types. For example, a copter with a gasoline generator that produces electricity that feeds the motors. Promising hydrogen systems, aircraft with solar panels and others.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_15.jpg) Control type classification: Autopilot and Remote control This division is also very arbitrary, because many unmanned vehicles belong to both groups simultaneously. For example, DJI Phantom can perform flights both in manual mode and in a pre-designed mission, during which it controlled by an autopilot.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_16.jpg) Another classification option - by application: 1. Toy - devices from the lowest price category, which allow you to get acquainted with the principles of control and gain experience in using a drone. Most often, their weight does not exceed 250 g, they do not need to be registered. 2. Consumer-use devices are more expensive and heavy. These include DJI Phantom, Mavic, Parrot ANAFI, Bebop models. These devices needs a registration because their weight exceeds 250 g. With their help, you can perform artistic aerial photography, film high-quality videos. And if you have the necessary knowledge and other equipment to carry out industrial work -- surveying quarries, settlements and so on. It is clear that industrial use is somewhat limited, but for many small companies or individuals, the purchase of such a device allows you to enter this market 3. Industrial. Here we include expensive models with high-quality optical and other sensors, designed both for artwork (DJI Inspire, DJI Mattrice 100 models), and models that are used for mapping, cadaster and mining tasks, for example, Geoscan-201, Supercam-350, DJI Mattrice 600 4. Model aircraft. They can be of all sizes - from the smallest, to devices with a wingspan of 3-5 meters. The propulsion system is also different. They are mainly controlled by remote controller. In Russia, there is a Federation of model aircraft sports that promotes this sport, as well as holds competitions in various categories. In this category it can be included home-made or self-assembled devices that can be quietly used for industrial work 5.Military drones are distinguished in a separate category. Like many technologies, UAV were originally designed for military tasks. In the army they are used for reconnaissance, electronic warfare, jamming and for accurate target designation. 6. Other. This includes promising devices that will be used as unmanned aerial taxi, cargo delivery, monitoring in cities and others There are two main types can be distinguished by weight: Lighter than air and Heavier than air

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_17.jpg) In Russia, another weight classification is appropriate: 1. Up to 250 grams - such a device does not need to be registered 2. 250 grams - 30 kg. Starting September 27, 2019, such devices must be registered with the Federal Air Transport Agency of Russia. 3. Heavier than 30 kg. Such vehicle must be registered with the Federal Air Transport Agency of Russia, and must receive SLG - airworthiness certificate. The company which use such UAV must have an operator certificate.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_18.jpg) Lighter-than-air devices can be divided into airships and balloons. The first aircraft in the history was lighter-than-air. This aircraft use either heated air or light gas such as hydrogen or helium. The 20s and 30s of the 20th century are a golden time for airships. Huge bullet-shaped zeppelins made transatlantic flights. However, this era ended with the crash of the Hindenburg airship on May 6, 1937. A terrible fire had taken the lives of half the passengers and crew. After this event, the governments of the countries of the main airship operators issued acts banning passenger flights. The development of airships has stopped for more than 50 years.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_19.jpg) Now there is a slight renaissance in this area because of the active use of non-combustible Helium gas and new composite materials. It seems that autonomous airships will be used to deliver heavy loads over long distances in the future.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_20.jpg) The second popular forecast is using the airship as a flying base for light quadrocopters. Drone in the flying "house". The main function is the "last mile" delivery from large companies such as Amazon Advantages of airships are long-range flight and the opportunity to be in the air for a very long time. Disadvantages are low speed, large sizes Now about heavier-than-air UAVs.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_21.jpg) There are two main types and one combined type. 1 Fixed-wing type has similar to an airplane shape. It usually designed in a single wing, sometimes it has fuselage. 2 main type - Multirotor systems that can hover over a point and take-off vertically 3 type - combining the advantages of the previous ones - hybrid Fixed-wing UAVs are divided into: Miniature UAVs or small UAVs (SUAV), Medium altitude, long endurance UAVs (MALE), High altitude, long endurance UAVs (HALE) The second and third types are mostly used for military purposes. For civilian purposes usually SUAVs are used. ![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_22.jpg) The picture shows a SUAV Delair UX11 Advantages are: a good range and flight duration. Disadvantages: can not hover over a place, requires some space for take-off and landing.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_23.jpg) The second main type is Multirotor UAV They are: Multirotor (more than 2 rotors), Twin-rotor helicopter, Single-rotor helicopter In turn, multirotor are often called by the number of rotors: quad, hex, and octocopter. The most popular option - quadcopter Two-rotor helicopters come with cross or coaxial propellers. Single-rotor helicopters are "classic" helicopters that are familiar to everyone with one main rotor and one tail rotor, which compensates for the helicopter reactive moment There are different sizes, up to the smallest - toys

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_24.jpg) Advantages:Ability to hover over a point, Needs a small landing area (up to 5m\*5m), Higher flight stability Disadvantages: Low endurance and Relatively short distance.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_25.jpg) There is a third type - hybrid. It combines the advantages of the first two types Hybrids are divided into: Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) with a fixed-wing. Also with rotary wing or rotary engine.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_26.jpg) The hybrid type combines the advantages of a wing and vertical take-off, can hover over a point and can plan without an engine working. However, this scheme also has some disadvantages - high structural complexity and low efficiency of the aircraft Also, disadvantages include: Lower payload, Shorter range and flight time, Higher cost We have considered various approaches to the classification of UAVs. The most important thing that you must bear is that they are very different and that there is no universal classification.

## Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Construction

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_29.jpg) Let's consider UAV construction Every UAV consists of structural mechanical parts and on-board electronic equipment The first category includes wings, screws, body, flaps, etc. The second one includes autopilot board, motors, surveying and navigation equipment, payload, etc.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_30.jpg) Majority of vehicles used in commercial unmanned aerial photography in Russia are either a flying wing with an electric motor or a quadcopter with an electric engine. At the same time, the take-off weight can range greatly from 0.5 kg and up to 12 kg Multirotor quadcopters better suit for photography with further 3D-modelling or where the conditions of take-off/landing are quite limited, because they need a small take-off area. Fixed-wing better suites for areas far from the starting point or for large areas because they can stay in the air for much longer00:01:02,000 --\> 00:01:10,000 So let's look at the design features of these two types. The picture shows us DJI Phantom 4 quadcopter. Its shape and appearance are very recognizable. The screws are quick-removable, made of plastic. From the main body there are down directed two racks, between which there is a suspension with the camera. We can immediately pay attention to the aerodynamic form, which helps to achieve the efficiency of the flight.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_31.jpg) In the following image you can see the Geoscan-201 drone. It is made in the form of a single wing. The wings are made of EPP - Expanded PolyPropilene. The main red body is made of composite material. All electronics are located inside the body. There is also a parachute. During flight, control is carried out by two elevons There is one screw it pushes the drone. The plane is easy to assemble and disassemble. It takes no more than 10 minutes. Now let's talk about electronic components.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_32.jpg) And we'll start with the most important thing - the brain of the whole system - Autopilot Autopilot is a hardware and software complex which performs several functions: 1. Estimation of position and motion parameters of the UAV in the space 2. Control propulsion system 3. Information exchange with the control station Autopilot collects information from various sensors - inertial system, satellite navigation system and other others The automatic flight issue, or at least maintaining certain flight parameters, appeared immediately after aviation birth. The first invention in this area appeared in the USA in 1912. Sperry Corporation has created a "gyroscopic stabilizing apparatus" that helps to maintain flight direction and stabilize the roll angle. The first flight of an aircraft with such a device took place on June 18, 1914 in France It is clear that the initial task was to help the pilot and reduce his workload. However, it quickly became clear that it was possible to create an autonomously controlled device with striking elements. This is the way how appeared that thigs which called torpedoes and cruise missiles now. The pioneers in this direction were the German developers of the famous V-2 cruise missile. It used an autopilot based on a gyroscope. The autopilot controlled flight mode, engines and rudders.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_33.jpg) The hardware of the autopilot includes several components: 1. The power supply system provides power management for the remaining components of the UAV, and also performs the functions of monitoring the correctness of their work. The system includes: battery controllers, voltage converters, various sensors. The battery controller calculates the consumed energy, residual capacity, and the number of charge-discharge cycles. Converters are necessary for the formation of various voltages to power the other components of the UAV 2. Sensor system includes all kinds of sensors necessary to determine the position of the UAV in space. For example: 1. airspeed sensor; 2. ultrasonic range finder; 3. infrared rangefinders; 4. optical flow systems All of these components are required to improve flight safety and autonomy. 3. Communication system includes components which transmit telemetry and a video signal from the UAV to the operator and these components also transmit controlling signals from the operator to the UAV. In modern systems, they use radio modems and radio communications, UAVs of the lower and middle price categories are equipped with wi-fi modules. It is worth noting that radio communication is more stable for long distances. In the civilian sector, peaks reach 60-70 km. Devices like DJI Phantom and so on are equipped with wi-fi. The effective radius differs from the declared one and does not exceed 1.5 km in a loose urban area. Under ideal conditions, the distance still does not exceed a couple of kilometers. However, you can by modified control panels with replaced antennas which allow you to increase the distance to 5 - 7 km. 4. Flight controller. Usually this is a board or microcomputer that performs the central function of collecting, processing information and issuing control signals to other UAV systems. If the autopilot is the brain of the UAV, then the flight controller is the brain of the autopilot. Let's move to the software part of the autopilot. It consists of several control modules. First of all is the UAV control module. This is a program that is installed in the flight controller. It performs the formation of control signals and the processing of incoming information. There are two levels of this module: Low - control the position of the drone in space, flight High -- UAV flight according to the flight mission Positioning module - as the name implies, it interacts with control systems and transfers information about the exact position to the control module. In addition to these modules, the program part includes any low and high-level microprograms ��� communication module, data storage, payload management, and so on.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_34.jpg) The main thing in most UAVs is the navigation system. The navigation system combines an Inertial Measuring Unit (these are various sensors - gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers) as well as a satellite navigation system consisting of a satellite receiver, often of a geodetic class. The Inertial Measuring Unit is based on the inertial navigation method. It, in turn, is based on the phenomenon of inertia of bodies. The most important advantage of this method is its autonomy, it means independence from the presence of external landmarks and signals. The essence of Inertial navigation is to determine the acceleration of an object and its angular velocities. Based on these data, the location of the object, course, speed, path, etc. are determined. In addition to these parameters, the necessary data are calculated to stabilize the flight of the object and autonomous control. What devices are used for this? 1. Accelerometers are linear acceleration sensors. Accelerometer is a device that measures the projection of the acceleration of a moving object (the difference between the true and gravitational acceleration). The acceleration value is calculated from these changes. The simplest examples are a spring load with a reading device. 2. Gyroscopes are devices that perform fast cyclic (rotational or oscillatory) movements. As a result, they are sensitive to rotation in inertial space. The simplest example is a baby yule. The untwisted gyroscope retains (with a certain accuracy) its position, and the system around it can be rotated and the angular orientation of the system relative to the gyroscope can be read. Gyroscopes allow you to determine the deviation of the coordinate system associated with the device's body from the coordinate system associated with the Earth, obtaining orientation angles: yaw (course), pitch and roll. Examples are shown in the picture. The autopilot receives the values of these angles and, the aircraft is controlled in accordance with them. 3. Magnetometers are instruments for measuring a magnetic field characteristic. These devices are used to obtain and clarify data on the flight speed of the UAV. The first complete inertial system emerged in the 50s in America and was very cumbersome, occupying several boxes. It is unlikely that we would be able to install a similar system on the UAV.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_35.jpg) Progress does not stand still and most UAV are equipped with high-precision MEMS - devices of very tiny sizes. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are devices combining microelectronic and micromechanical components. These devices operate on mechanical principles adjusted for miniature size. MEMS technologies are used to create a variety of miniature sensors such as accelerometers, angular velocity sensors, gyroscopes The picture shows a MEMS accelerometer. The smallest weights and suspensions are mechanical as in classical systems. However, motion detection is already in the field of electronics. There are capacitor, thermal, and piezo gyroscopes and accelerometers. For example, in capacitor accelerometers capacitor plates are placed on a moving weight and a fixed part. When they are displaced, its capacity changes. Knowing the mass and suspension parameters, accelerations can be calculated.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_36.jpg) The satellite navigation system is represented by a receiver of a different accuracy class - from consumer-use to high-precision geodetic receivers. With this board the autopilot receives information about the spatial position of the UAV. We will talk more about satellite methods in the third module.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_37.jpg) The combination of spatial position, UAV tilt angles, airspeed sensor and wind speed data allows the autopilot to efficiently and accurately control the flight throughout its duration UAV application temperature range is wide: from -50 to +50 Critical weather conditions are precipitation and wind speed. Most UAVs operate at wind speed up to 15 m / s. Precipitation is not always an obstacle to the flight itself, but it interferes the performance of the aerial photography, because image quality becomes significantly worse In this lesson, we have considered UAV structure, its main types and application features.

## UAV Payload types

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_40.jpg) 
Music Good day! The payload can include any device from which you can get different information about the flight or space: Airspeed sensors, ultrasonic and laser altimeters Photo and video cameras, lidars, radars, magnetometers. 

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_41.jpg) 
There are two types of payload: flight payload and mounted payload. 

Let us talk about the flight payload. This category includes all auxiliary equipment, which increases flight autonomy and safety: Autopilot, Navigation system Air pressure receivers - a system that is used in aviation to determine an aircraft's airspeed, Mach number, altitude, and altitude trend. The most often used in UAVs are Pitot tubes. 

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_42.jpg) 
Ultrasonic rangefinders - used in multicopters to ensure a safe and accurate landing. Infrared rangefinders help to prevent collisions with obstacles. This slide illustrates a cirquit with ultrasonic rangefinders that are used in DGI Phantom 4 UAVs. The mounted payload category includes equipment that allows you to perform production tasks – aerial photography, spectrometry, video monitoring.

According to the information obtaining method, payload can be divided into passive and active metods. Passive method – device detects certain signals from the earth's surface – for example, cameras detect reflected sunlight. The active method involves preliminary irradiation of the studied objects - for example, lidar (LiDAR) or radar.

Let us discuss RGB-photocameras. RGB cameras are the most popular payload. They differ in the following parameters: Size of the matrix; The effective resolution of a matrix, number of pixels; Shutter - Central or slit. Serious requirements are imposed on the camera lens, because it is the main thing that affects the optical distortion of the picture. Lenses differ in aberration, amount of blurring, distortion. 

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_46.jpg)
Well-known manufacturers of cameras: Sony, Leica, PhaseOne. RGB cameras are used for: Orthomosaic creating, Shooting high-rise objects, 3D-models creating.

NIR-range (near infrared) cameras are widely used in forestry and agriculture. They provide information about vegetation state, since chlorophyll in plants reflects light in the NIR range. Largely, the characteristics of NIR and RGB cameras are similar. Basically, NIR and RGB cameras are combined into a single device with channel diversity. 


![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_48.jpg)
Hyperspectral cameras differ from multispectral ones in a large number of channels - up to 450. Each channel is a narrow band with a spectral resolution of 1.3 nm to 5 nm. Hyperspectral cameras are used for geological exploration, environmental surveys, and forest taxation work.

Thermal imaging cameras produce pictures based on infrared radiation of objects, which makes it possible to obtain information at night or to find objects by indirect signs (thermal trace of heating mains). There are different temperature determining methods: Absolute and Relative. 


![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_50.jpg)
Magnetometer is an instrument system that measures the characteristics of the Earth’s magnetic field. Magnetometer usage makes possible to find ore bodies in the thickness of the earth. Mostly used in geological exploration.

This slide illustrates payload types based on active methods: LiDAR and Different types of radars. Consider LIDAR. 

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_52.jpg)
The word LIDAR is an abbreviation - Light Identification Detection and Ranging. It must be emphasized that the word light is used, since there is a slight misconception that scanning from LIDARs is a laser scannig. In fact, in modern systems based on UAVs, lasers are practically never used - other light sources are used. In the picture you can see the LIDAR working scheme. We have a source and a receiver, as illustrated in this figure. The source generates a signal and sends it to the object. A part of the signal is returned (it is never 100%) and the receiver reads this information. There are various methods for determining the distance to an object. 


![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_53.jpg)
Let us consider the various types of LIDARs usually installed on UAV. The table shows several options from various manufacturers. They differ in such characteristics as the scanning speed (the number of dots per second that this LIDAR is capable to receive), the maximum distance to objects, the number of reflections, weight and, of course, cost. The number of scan points greatly depends on the speed of rotation of the LIDAR and the number of emitters and receivers installed in it. There are usually several of these, to increase efficiency. The power of these sources directly affects the range. Modern LIDAR systems usually operate at a range of 200, maximum 300 meters. The number of reflections is one of the important parameters, it is the main advantage of LIDARs over other systems. In fact, it is the ability to receive several reflections from objects per one impulse. What does it mean? An impulse is emitted and moves towards, let's say, a tree with foliage. Part of the impulse is reflected from, for example, a leaf, and part of the impulse moves on. This part is reflected from another leaf or other obstacle and so on until the power of the last reflected signal reaches a certain threshold value. This value is different for each LiDAR, but usually 10% of the initial pulse power. Thus, in the most advanced systems, an almost infinite number of reflections per pulse can be obtained. In more primitive systems that are installed on UAV, this number is usually limited to two, maximum three. If there are two, then this is usually the first reflection and the last. The most recent reflection is usually taken as reflection from the earth's surface. So, there is no magic in penetrate foliage, this is not an X-ray, the secret is several reflections per one impulse. It is also worth mentioning that only one company (Riegl Company) (you can see it in the slide) develops systems special for UAVs. . All the other LiDARs that are shown here, in fact, came from the field of unmanned vehicles (cars), which is now very actively developing. These devices allow an unmanned car to drive autonomously. Since the weight of these devices is already quite small (about 1 kg), and miniature gyroscopic systems have also been developed that allow the gyroscope to be placed on a 3x3 cm board, their combination allows scanning from the UAV. This slide shows a picture that compares two technologies. They are the photogrammetric technology and the LiDAR scanning technology. 

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_54.jpg)
As we see, in difficult areas (usually a forest, bushes or tall grass), photogrammetric technology does not show good results. It is able to get relief data only where there are large enough glades or other open areas. It is clear that the quality of the relief obtained using photogrammetric technology will not be very high. LiDAR, as you can see, allows you to "penetrate" under the foliage - I have explained the mechanism earlier - and provides reflection from the earth's surface. But we can’t immediately say that LiDAR is much better, and let's all of us use LiDARs. There are limitations on mass and, more importantly,  cost, and in certain areas, photogrammetric technology works better and, most importantly, it is cheaper and more productive. Therefore, these are two technologies that are often called upon to solve similar problems, but they have their own strengths and weaknesses. Today we have discussed the various types of payload that can be installed on the UAV. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, but certainly the most popular ones are mentioned. Further we will consider aerial photography implementation using fixed-wing UAV equipped with RGB camera.

## UAV and Aerial Photography Services Market Review
As we noted earlier, UAVs are very different in type, weight, size and purpose, and therefore their cost ranges from several thousand rubles to tens of millions. Payload cost can sometimes be several times higher than the cost of the aircraft itself. For example -- lidars. Let's look at the different UAV types and their cost in the Russian market.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_56.jpg)
Let's start with toys. These are mainly quadcopters or single-rotor helicopters - they are sold in toy stores, on special websites dedicated to airborne vehicles, and in large Chinese trading websites. The cost of such devices starts from a couple of hundreds dollars. For this money you will get a small quadcopter with a remote control. Of course, there is no autopilot, only direct control from the remote controller, it also does not know how to hover over a point. Such devices replaced radio-controlled cars - because they make you feel like a pilot and are relatively safe. Hobby and model UAVs. People assemble such devices from ready-made kits or even produce spare parts on their own, for example, engines. The price of such devices varies greatly. The lowest threshold is 10--20 thousand rubles, the upper threshold is several million for large highly detailed models with internal combustion engines, or even jet engines.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_57.jpg)
These also include drone kits like Geoscan Pioneer and Clever by Copter Express. The largest market in quantitative and monetary terms is the consumer-use UAV market.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_58.jpg)
Almost all such devices are light quadcopters with a price of 60,000 - 150,000 rubles. The largest and most important player in this market is the Chinese company DJI. Its machines such as DJI Phantom 4 and Mavic 2 cost about 80-120 thousand rubles. It needs to be mentioned that the Phantom is no longer produced. In general, the entire current situation with the development of the UAV market is closely linked with the DJI company. They were able to introduce to the market a cheap, reliable, simple and mass solution that combines state-of-the-art technology and excellent design. No wonder they say that DJI is Apple among quadcopters. There was explosive demand for the first DJI models. Many people's childhood dream came true. Many, as children, wanted to become pilots or astronauts. Suddenly their dream was almost fulfilled, and with tremendous ease for that time. In addition to fulfilling their dreams, DJI drones gave photographers and ordinary people tools for creating breathtaking photos and videos. You cannot disagree that any photo taken from above even now looks unusual and interesting. One reason being that we are not got used to this angle at all.

In addition to DJI, we should mention Parrot and its Bebop and Anafi models. Other Chinese manufacturers sell low-cost devices, often similar to market leaders. DJI's total part in this sector is about 65%. There are well-known examples when drones were produced under the brand name of a company operating in an adjacent market. These include, for example, a quite unsuccessful product from GoPRO - it was supposed to be a continuation of the company's philosophy - - a device for shooting extreme sports. However, they were not very successful. Another example is a drone from Intel. A layperson may be very surprised - why does an IT company produce an aircraft? The fact is that Intel has serious developments in swarm intelligence, when many different devices work according to shared logic. They communicate and create images together. The company uses these technologies to create colorful Drone Shows. Intel is the world champion in the number of simultaneously flown copters.

The technology received wide attention during the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. In Russia, the record belongs to the Geoscan Group, in August 2019, 500 quadrocopters were launched at the ceremony of celebrating the 80th anniversary of VDNH in Moscow. 

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_60.jpg)
The next category is UAV for artistic shooting. In the UAV subcategory for artistic shooting, DJI reigns supreme again. Here are models DJI Inspire, DJI Inspire 2 and DJI Mattrice. Perhaps, now there is no movie left, especially in the action category, where filming from the UAV is not used. Thanks to their application, it became possible to obtain cheaper but high-quality shots. Such devices are often used by bloggers on YouTube. They take beautiful pictures of nature, for example, if the theme of the blog is dedicated to travelling. The cost of such devices varies from 250 thousand to 1-2 million rubles, depending on the configuration and payload. The most expensive is the DJI Mattrice 600 quadcopter, with a three-axis gimbal stabilizer, a Zenmuse X7 camera or a similar camera from Sony, Canon, and so on and all the necessary additions - batteries, bags, etc. 

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_61.jpg)
Another subcategory includes devices designed to receive remote data from the Earth. In this market, the main role is played by fixed-wing UAVs with a flight time up to 4 hours and heavy multicopters - - platforms carrying specialized equipment, for example, magnetometers or gas analyzers. The cost of such devices starts at half a million. The upper limit is almost unlimited and can reach up to 15 million for a drone with a lidar. The main manufacturers in Russia are Geoscan Group, Zala, Finko. In the world, SenseFly can be called a tentative leader. One of its features is launching airplanes from the hand - no catapult is needed. However, they have a weak wind resistance because they are light enought for a person to lift them. The high cost is due to the small number of UAVs produced and the focus on the B2B market. The cost of military UAVs is often classified. Operational and tactical military UAVs cost from 10 million rubles. Strike UAVs that carry combat payload are even more expensive. Prototypes for air taxi purposes are generally not amenable to cost evaluation, since no model has emerged from the R&D


![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_62.jpg)
Let's talk about the global market and sales. The total market is estimated at 12-15 billion dollars, in numerical terms it is more than 1.5 million devices. Market growth is quite rapid - 5-10% per year. In Russia, sales are estimated at 2 billion rubles. The main areas of growth - delivery, agriculture, infrastructure.

![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_63.jpg)
 We'll briefly talk about the cost of payloads. In the consumer sector, the camera is the main element of the UAV, and nearly all drones are equipped with it, you can rarely see a drone without a camera. Otherwise, the cost of cameras from 35 to 500 thousand rubles. The cost of NIR cameras is higher - from 80 to 800 thousand rubles. The cost of special equipment - magnetometers, gas analyzers, etc. - - can be as high as 3 million rubles. 
Lidars are the most expensive, costing from 3 to 15 million rubles.


![](img/1/1695652199154-3422a158-3a4b-47ed-9863-f692f03b7c5d_64.jpg)
Now let's move on to the services market. The world market is estimated at 120 billion dollars. Of these, the Russian market is just about 9 billion rubles. As you can see, we have room to grow. The service market in Russia can be divided into: 1. Linear object monitoring. Since we have a very large country and pipeline transport between the extractive industry and the consumer segments is highly developed, the issue of monitoring these pipes is extremely important. Annually tenders and contracts for several billion rubles are held. The main consumers of the service are Rosneft, Gazprom, Transneft. In one contract, the total length of flight routes can reach up to 200 thousand km. In this case, the cost of one km will be from 500 to 1500 rubles, depending on weather conditions and length ot the route. 2. Civil aerial photography for cartography, cadaster and the creation of urban planning documentation makes up the second main part of the services market. Gradually, unmanned aerial photography is repalcing piloting photography and traditional methods of creating maps and plans. The cost of services for creating an orthomosaic starts from 3 thousand rubles for a scale of 1:5000 and reaches 30-40 thousand per square kilometer for a scale of 1: 500 for small areas. The artistic shooting market is the third important segment of the Russian market. Prices vary greatly depending on the type of end product. Filming a wedding may cost 10-15 thousand rubles, whereas filming a professional promovideo - a few million rubles. Let us summarize. The UAV and aerial services market has experienced strong growth over the past few years. This is due both to technological progress and to increasing cheapness of UAV applications in different fields. Analysts assess the dynamics as positive, the growth will continue. The Russian part is currenly relatively small, but drones play a huge role in the Russian economy.
